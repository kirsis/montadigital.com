                <p>We believe that great apps are simple but polished, and that they adhere to platform conventions. A mobile app must be as familiar to new users, as possible.</p>

                <p>The user interface must be tailored to each possible device, from the smallest iPhone, to the largest iPad. If the user experience suffers because of different device form factors, then the app has failed its core mission - to bring value to the user.</p>

                <p>We always target the latest version of iOS, so that we are free to use the newest and most powerful operating system features.</p>

</figure>

<div class="inbetween text-container">
    <p class="intro">The closest thing to a server that Apple sells, is the venerable Mac mini. We needed some for ourselves - to do builds or execute tests - and this requirement turned into a small side-project providing VPS hosting.</p>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
                <p>Some people use them as we do - for development needs. Others just like OS&nbsp;X and use it for e-mail servers or landing page hosting.</p>
                
                <p>Some Windows users just want to try out OS&nbsp;X for a while.</p>

                <p>We kept the workflow simple - pay via PayPal, receive e-mail, connect via VNC. Done.</p>
                
                <p>Since OS&nbsp;X EULA forbids too many virtualized instances of the operating system per device, we have kept this as a small side project and will not be turning this into a large scale operation.</p>
